# 🎬 MotivAgent Demo - ODSC Agentic AI Hackathon 2025

## 🎯 Problem Statement & Solution

**The Problem**: Traditional fitness and productivity apps are boring, generic, and forgettable. Users quickly lose motivation because feedback lacks personality and engagement.

**Our Solution**: MotivAgent transforms mundane activity logging into an entertaining experience using **AI-powered sarcastic motivation**. By combining Google Gemini's language capabilities with intelligent activity parsing, we create a "RoastBot" personality that makes users actually *want* to track their daily activities.
